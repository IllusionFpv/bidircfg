Config snippets to reconfigure some boards for bidirectional dshot 

Some boards require reconfiguration of some timers or dma streams to work with bidirectional dshot. 
This repo hosts snippets which implement these changes on stock firmware starting from 4.0 RC1.
Just copy and paste the snippet for your board into the CLI and finalize with "save".
